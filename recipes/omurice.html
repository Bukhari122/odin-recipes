    <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li><b>Make the Sauce</b>:  In a small saucepan, whisk together some tonkatsu sauce 
                    (depending on desired sweetness and tanginess), a splash of soy sauce, and a tablespoon of water. 
                    Heat the mixture gently over low heat until warmed through, stirring occasionally. 
                    If the sauce seems too thick, add a little more water to thin it out.</li><br>
                <li><b>Assemble the Omurice</b>: Heat a pat of butter in a separate pan over medium heat. 
                    Once melted, swirl the butter to coat the pan.</li><br>
                <li><b>Cook the Omelette</b>:  Whisk together the eggs, milk, and a pinch of salt in a bowl. 
                    Pour the egg mixture into the pan and tilt the pan to spread the eggs into an even layer.</li><br>
                <li><b>Fill and Fold</b>:  Once the bottom of the omelette is set and the top is still slightly wet, 
                    add your cooked rice to one half of the omelette.  Sprinkle the rice with some diced vegetables 
                    and drizzle with a little tonkatsu sauce (optional).</li><br>
                <li><b>Plate and Serve</b>:  Slide the omelette onto a plate. Drizzle with additional tonkatsu sauce 
                    and serve with a side of ketchup (optional) and Kewpie mayonnaise (optional) for dipping.</li><br>

            </ol>
