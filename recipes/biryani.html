            <li><b>Marinate the Chicken:</b>Combine yogurt, ginger, garlic, spices, and lemon juice. 
                Marinate chicken pieces for at least 30 minutes, or preferably overnight for deeper flavor.</li><br>
                <li><b>Cook the Rice:</b>Soak basmati rice for 30 minutes. In a separate pot, heat ghee/oil, add cloves, cardamom, cumin seeds, bay leaf, and cinnamon.
                     Briefly fry, then add rinsed rice and enough water to cover it by an inch. 
                     Season with salt and cook covered until rice is 70% cooked and water is absorbed.</li><br>
                <li><b>Prepare the Masala</b>Fry onions in ghee/oil until golden brown. 
                    Add ginger, garlic, green chilies, and cook until fragrant. 
                    Add tomatoes (if using), spices like coriander powder, turmeric, 
                    and red chili powder. Cook until masala thickens.</li><br>
                <li><b>Assemble the Biryani:</b>In a pot, layer half the cooked rice, followed by the marinated chicken, 
                    masala, and any dried fruits like raisins or plums. 
                    Repeat layers with remaining rice. Sprinkle saffron water (if using) 
                    and a few drops of kewra water (optional) for extra fragrance.</li><br>
                <li><b>Seal and Cook:</b>Seal the pot tightly with foil or a damp cloth. Cook on low heat for 20-25 minutes, 
                    or until the chicken is cooked through and flavors are well combined.</li><br>
                <li><b>Garnish and Serve:</b>Fluff the biryani with a fork and garnish with fresh coriander leaves and mint. 
                    Enjoy your delicious Biryani!</li><br>
